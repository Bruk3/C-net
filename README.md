### Environment setup 


### Instructions to merge code with master
Since 5 people have to contribute code to the same repository, things can get messy really easily. That's why we should try to enforce certain coding guidelines. 

We can follow a simple workflow where each person creates a feature branch and makes pull requests to master. This simple [git collaboration workflow](https://gist.github.com/adamloving/5690951) basically has all the git commands you'd need (The only thing missing is `git pull`). 

Things to note:
- Create temporary feature branches for implementing small but __working__ features. Once you've implemented this task and your pull request has been merged to master, you should delete your current feature branch and create a new one for your next feature.
- When you make a pull request, a github CI action will immediately start running 

#### Commit Messages 
Having standarized commit messages that are easy to read and understand can be super helpful and easy to implement.
By taking 5 more seconds to write better commit messages, we can make each other's lives easier.

Let's try to follow 2, 3, and 5. 



### Suggested Development Environment 

#### Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editor. 
__Why VSCode?__ 
- Automated Linting (Has support for ocaml plugins)
- Code Completion
- In-File Git commit version comparison
- User friendly interface to resolve merge conflicts
- If you're a VIM junkie, has support for VIM plugins
- When we want to help each other debug code by sharing screen, having a similar dev environment would be helpful for every
