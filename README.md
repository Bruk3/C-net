# C-net
__C-net programming language__ - Network programming never got easier


## Environment setup

To run the hello world executable:
- First simply run `make`to generate the `cnet.native` compiler.
    - Once the compiler is built, all of the unit tests and the integration tests will be executed.
- Run `./ccnet tests/integration/test-hello-world.cnet` to generate the hello-world executable.

- Run `tests/integration/test-hello-world.exe` to see the `Hello World!` output.

__Note__ The compiler assumes that the llvm compiler and interpreter are part of the
system's path.

More environment setup instructions coming soon.
